# Base-Antlr
Use this repo as a base repo for antlr exercises.

## Before start
You have to install Antlr 4 plugin before any operation.

## How to start
 1. Put in `src/main/antlr` dir all .g4 files.

 2. Put in `src/main/java` all your java classes.  
You can implement Singleton Factory Pattern if you want to generate necessary objects.  
You can put in src/main/ other directories for any language you want.

 3. Put in `src/test/java` dir all your test classes.  
You can put all into main java dir, or you can use more practical Unit tests.  
You can put in src/main/ other directories for any language you want.

 4. Put your test resources in `src/test/resources`, start classes or tests
  and check if all is right!
